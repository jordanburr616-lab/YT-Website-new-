          <p>Hey there! My name is Jordan and I am dedicated help YOU yes you improve everyday. </p>

          <p>Growing up, I've always felt like an outcast. I was fat and lazy always trying so hard to get anyone's attention but yet I fell short.
          So I resulted into watching self improvement videos. I became obsessed, in love with the idea that I can get better each
          and every day. So as soon as covid hit, I decided it was time to change my life. I lost a ton of weight. Replacing that with muscle.
          It got me motivated to keep on going. PR after PR, I became obsessed with growth. It led to me doing one of the ballsiest things I've ever
          done, start a youtube channel. Despite my growth being that significant yet, I'm passionate about it. So passionate that I decided I want to
          create my own website about my youtube channel!</p>
        
          <p>On here, I want to help you guys get better. I known the past me would've loved to have someone where to go or look rather than having to find
          it themselves. On here is my workout program. One that I've created all by myself with lots of research to back up my routine. There's an organizational
          section that will help you just straighten out your life. Last but not least, I have my discord where I want to build a community of like-minded individuals
          where we'll give ourselves positive peaces of advice and signs of hope that they can improve.</p>

          <p>If you're interested in any of these, navigate to the top of my website and I have different sections for each!
          Curious about my channel and my other socials? The links are right below this section! Have a few questions? Well feel free
          to email me down below!</p>
