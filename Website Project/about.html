        <p>Hey there. If you don't know me, my name is Jordan Burr and I've been working towards something for the past few years...
            What is that something exactly? Well something that people can always turn to whenever they are struggling in life or just want guidance. Because
            I understand, life is hard and some of us don't have anyone to turn to. I want to be the ear people never thought they could have.
        </p>

        <h1 class="section-highlights"><strong>My life:</strong></h1>
        <p>Growing up, I always thought of myself as a terrible person. I thought everything I did as a kid was only hurting me and others around me. I was miserable growing up
            but I would never show it. I was what they called "shy" in school but the reality was that I kept everything to myself. Mostly because the people around me were always
            so happy and I never wanted to be the reason that they're not. So I kept to myself but one day it was almost my last.

            My feet at the very edge. Standing over the bridge... I was contemplating jumping. "Is there any hope for me?" Memories started to flow through my head.
            Then things I never noticed like all the happy moments came rushing in. Because I was blindsided by negativity, it's all I ever thought about and why I was about to jump.
            But I stepped back and instead of jumping off the bridge, I wanted to give my life 1 more chance.

            So I began to do the one thing I never could've imagined, improve. I used to be fat and I never worked out really outside of old sports I
            used to play. I was constantly made fun of cause of my experience. But I finally said enough was enough. I remember things starting out shaky but I got a rush that I've never felt before. I felt like I was seeing
            what I saw on top of the bridge. The potential of who I really can become. Months passed and I started to see real progress. Yet I wasn't satisfied with just working out. I started journaling
            eating better, waking up early, and more all so that I can keep on improving everyday. 

            It led to one of the most defying moments of my life. A sign that I have conquered that version of myself that saw me as a terrbile person... starting
            a Youtube channel. One of the best decisions I've ever made. Creating a youtube channel to me felt like I made huge progress. From someone who hated everything about themselves to appreciating the little things. 
            Well to be honest, it took a while to find my footing but now I know exactly what I want with this channel.
