What the Site Should Include (Initial Version)

Header: Your name and a navigation bar (Home, Projects, Contact)
About Me: A short intro: who you are, what you love to build
Projects: 2–3 project descriptions with titles, images, and GitHub links
Contact: A way to reach you (email or social links)
Footer:	Copyright and maybe a quote or logo

Notes:

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
- It’s the language used to style and visually design your web pages.
If HTML is the structure (like walls, windows, doors),
then CSS is the paint, layout, fonts, and decorations.

THE FINAL PUSH: (what needs to be fixed before version 1.0 releases)

- The tab image is a little too low (DONE)
- 2 javascript projects only run during the home tab (DONE)
- javascript page transition definitely needs tweeks (DONE)
- Update transition images to have quotes (DONE)
- Bottom scroller? (DONE)
